LangGraph Multi-Agent System Explanation
Overview
This code implements a sophisticated multi-agent system using LangGraph that coordinates multiple AI agents to perform research and document creation tasks. The system consists of two main teams (ResearchTeam and PaperWritingTeam) supervised by a top-level supervisor.

Key Components
1. Tools Definition
The system provides several specialized tools:

Web Tools:

scrape_webpages(): Uses WebBaseLoader to scrape content from URLs

TavilySearchResults(): Performs web searches using Tavily API

Document Tools:

create_outline(): Creates and saves document outlines

read_document(): Reads documents from the filesystem

write_document(): Writes content to documents

edit_document(): Edits documents by inserting text at specific lines

Code Execution Tool:

python_repl(): Executes Python code (with safety warnings)

2. Agent Teams
ResearchTeam
Search Agent: Uses Tavily search tool to find information

WebScraper Agent: Scrapes web pages for detailed content

Supervisor: Coordinates between search and scraping agents

PaperWritingTeam
DocWriter: Handles document writing and editing

NoteTaker: Creates outlines and takes notes

ChartGenerator: Generates charts using Python code execution

Supervisor: Coordinates the writing process

3. State Management
The system uses typed state dictionaries to manage:

Message history between agents

Team member information

Next action routing

File system state

4. Graph Architecture
Research Graph:

text
START → Supervisor → [Search ↔ WebScraper] → END
Authoring Graph:

text
START → Supervisor → [DocWriter ↔ NoteTaker ↔ ChartGenerator] → END
Super Graph:

text
START → Supervisor → [ResearchTeam ↔ PaperWritingTeam] → END
Teaching Points
1. Multi-Agent Coordination
The system demonstrates how to:

Create specialized agents with specific tools

Use supervisors to route tasks between agents

Maintain conversation history across multiple agents

Handle conditional branching based on agent outputs

2. State Management
Using TypedDict for type-safe state management

Annotated lists for message accumulation with operator.add

Maintaining file system context across agents

3. Tool Design
Creating reusable, specialized tools

Handling file I/O operations safely

Executing code with proper error handling

Web scraping and search integration

4. Graph Construction
Adding nodes and edges to state graphs

Creating conditional edges for dynamic routing

Compiling graphs into executable chains

Handling recursion limits for complex workflows

Key Code Patterns to Highlight
1. Agent Node Pattern
python
def agent_node(state, agent, name):
    result = agent.invoke(state)
    return {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=result["messages"][-1].content, name=name)]}
2. Supervisor Creation
python
def create_team_supervisor(llm, system_prompt, members):
    # Creates routing function with JSON output parsing
3. Graph Construction
python
graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("agent_name", agent_function)
graph.add_edge("node1", "node2")
graph.add_conditional_edges("supervisor", routing_function)
4. Context Awareness
python
context_aware_agent = prelude | agent  # Pipe operator for composition
Teaching Approach
Step 1: Basic Concepts
Explain what LangGraph is and why it's useful for multi-agent systems

Demonstrate simple agent creation with tools

Show basic graph construction

Step 2: Team Coordination
Explain supervisor pattern and routing

Show how agents communicate through shared state

Demonstrate conditional workflow routing

Step 3: Advanced Patterns
File system integration and context management

Code execution safety considerations

Recursion limits and error handling

Step 4: Real-world Application
Research and report generation workflow

Team specialization and tool allocation

End-to-end system demonstration

Safety Considerations
The python_repl tool executes code locally (highlight the risks)

Web scraping should respect robots.txt and terms of service

File system operations need proper sandboxing in production

Recursion limits prevent infinite loops

Extension Ideas
Add more specialized agents (data analysis, image generation)

Implement persistence for long-running tasks

Add user approval steps for critical operations

Implement rate limiting and usage tracking

This system provides an excellent foundation for teaching advanced multi-agent concepts and could be extended for various educational and practical applications
